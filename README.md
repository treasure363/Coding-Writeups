## Introduction
Competitive Programming is a fun and challenging way to improve your problem-solving skills. In this repository, you'll find my solutions to coding challenges from various events conducted in my University.

## Contest Solutions
I organize my solutions by contest name and provided Solution in different programming languages like C, C++, Java, Python. And I also provided a brief explanation of my approach I used to write my solution.  
Here's how the directory structure is organized:

```
- Contest_Name/
  - Set_Number[if any]
    - Problem_ID/
        - Solution.c
        - Solution.cpp
        - Solution.java
        - README.md
        - Solution.py
  - README.md
```

- `Contest_Name`: The name of the coding contest.
- `Set_Number`: If the coding contest has different Sets available.
- `Problem_ID`: The unique identifier for each problem in the contest.
- `solution.cpp`: The source code for my solution.
- `README.md`: A detailed explanation of my approach and solution.

Feel free to explore the contests and problems that interest you!

## How to Use
You can browse through the contests and problems to learn from the solutions or use them as a reference when you encounter similar problems. If you have suggestions or improvements for any solution, please feel free to open an issue or submit a pull request.
