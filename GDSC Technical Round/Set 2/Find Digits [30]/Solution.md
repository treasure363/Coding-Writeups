[Find Digits](https://www.hackerrank.com/contests/gdsc-coding-round-2023-set-2/challenges/find-digits/problem) (Difficulty-Easy, 30 points)  

The problem statement is clear through which we can figure out that we need to check number of digits present in the given input that divides it completely.  
An optimum way to do what would be by extracting individual digits and checking it's modulo. But wait! what if the digit is 0? we would have to skip the checking in that case.  
The sample test case provided 1012 has 0 in it to help you understand it.
